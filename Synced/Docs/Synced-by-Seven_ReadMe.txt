Synced by Seven: ReadMe-file
============================


Recommended Platform: Windows 7

Recommended Screen:   1920 x 1200

Accessories:          Gamepads: one Xbox 360 Controller per player (e.g. USB-connected, with two thumb sticks))

Players:              1-4 (2-4 recommended) - each player will get its own colour:  Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.
     

Game Idea:            Each player has two icons of the player colour, one of a little lighter colour, one of a little darker.
                      Left and right thumb stick each controls one of the two icons.
                      The purpose is to make goals by picking up the small crystal and shoot - backwards - it into one of the goals.
                      By controlling your two icons as a team it is possible to gain advantages:
                                  - Higher speed
                                  - Creating a net between the icons to catch the crystal
                                  - Creating an attack/defence mechanism that disturbs your competitors "Power-Up:s".

Game Winning:        The first player to score 5 goals is proclaimed as the Winner.



Game Preparations:    Copy file Synced.exe to a hard disk folder of your own discretion.
                      Connect Xbox 360 Controllers, one per player. 
                      (The first time this is done, it takes a few minutes to get down the drivers so you must be connected to the internet!)

Game Start:           Double click on file Synced.exe
Game End:             Click on "Back" on Xbox 360 Controller


Game Beginning:       The game starts with a menu screen; here each player selects type of game icon:
                      Each player has control over a menu in one quarter of the screen, 
                      each identified with a colour: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.
                      The selected icon is used for your two player icons.
                      The selected Zone is used as your defence/attack mechanism; each has its own behaviour.
                      On your Xbox 360 controller:
                        (1) Click on button A (green) to participate in the game.
                        (2) Now with the left thumb stick select left <-> right the type of icon / zone you would like to have: 
                                Icon:             Zone:                          Mechanism:
                                -----             -----                          ----------
                                Circle            Circle of Tar                  Slows done captured player as in a tar pit.
                                Hexagon           Hexacopy                       The captured player will be created in multiple incarnations, 
                                                                                 all moving the same way but after a few seconds all but one will disappear.

                                Square            Square Prison                  Captured player is stuck inside the box.
                                Triangle          Bermuda Triangle               Captured player disappears and the reappears somewhere else.
                        (3) Click on button A again to confirm the selected icon.
                        (4) When all players have done the selection, the game will begin when player 1 clicks on the small Xbox Start-button.
                     Note: More than one player may select the same Icon - the colour will differ.


Game Playing:         Use the thumb sticks to control speed and direction of each of you icons.
                      Try to pick-up the crystal by getting close to it, when picked-up speed to one of the goals, turn 180 degrees and shoot it towards the goal.
                      

Game Mischiefs:       Control your two icons in selected patterns and there is a reward: a zone-bomb is created!
                      Pick up the bomb - the same way as a crystal - and transport it into a good position and then shoot it towards your adversaries,
                      then, after some distance, the bomb will go off and create an zone that is effective for a few seconds.
                      Depending on your type of selected icon the zone bomb has different effects as shown in the table above!


Game Patterns:        Speed-up            - make your two icons go in parallel while activating the Power-Up control (Xbox Left/Right Trigger).
                      Create Zone Bomb    - make one icon tightly circle your other icon and a new bomb is created and may be picked-up.
